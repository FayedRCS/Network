## Build a Home Network

Routers typically have 2 ports; Ethernet and internet. In adition to wired ports, many include a radio antenna, and a built-in wireless access point.

## Home Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)

### Ethernet ports

Ports that connect to an internal switch portion of the router. Labeled Ethernet or LAN. All devices connected to the switch ports are on the same local network.

### Internet port

Used to connect the device to another network. It connects to a different network than the ethernet. Often used to connect to cable/DSL modem to access to the internet.
wireless

Wireless devices connect to the same local network as LAN. The internet ports is the only port connected to a different network in the default configuration.

## LAN Wireless Frequencies

The wireless technologies most frequently used in home networks are in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency ranges.
Bluetooth is a technology that makes use of the 2.4 GHz band. It is limited to low-speed, short-range communications, but has the advantage of communicating with many devices at the same time. 

Other technologies that use the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands are the modern wireless LAN technologies that conform to the various IEEE 802.11 standards. Unlike Bluetooth technology, 802.11 devices transmit at a much higher power level giving them a great range and improved throughput. Certain areas of the electromagnetic spectrum can be used without a permit.

The figure shows where wireless technologies exist on the electromagnetic spectrum:

## Wired Network Technologies

The most commonly implemented wired protocol is the Ethernet protocol. Ethernet uses a suite of protocols that allow network devices to communicate over a wired LAN connection. An Ethernet LAN can connect devices using many different types of wiring media.

Directly connected devices use an Ethernet patch cable, usually unshielded twisted pair. These cables can be purchased with the RJ-45 connectors already installed, and they come in various lengths. Recently constructed homes may have Ethernet jacks already wired in the walls of the home. For those homes that do not have UTP wiring, there are other technologies, such as powerline, that can distribute wired connectivity throughout the premises.

## Wireless Standards

The IEEE 802.11 standard governs the WLAN environment. There are amendments to the IEEE 802.11 standard that describe characteristics for different standards of wireless communications. Wireless standards for LANs use the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands. Collectively these technologies are referred to as Wi-Fi.

#### Network mode 
Determines the type of technology that must be supported. For example,802.11b,802.11g,802.11n or Mixed Mode.

#### Network Name (SSID)
Used to identify the WLAN. All devices that wish to participate in the WLAN must have the same SSID. SSID stands for Service Set Identifier.

#### Standard channel
Specifies the channel over which communication will occur. By default, this is set to Auto to allow the access point (AP) to determine the optimum channel to use.

#### SSID broadcast
Determines if the SSID will be broadcast to all devices within range. By default, set to Enabled.

Wireless devices contain radio transmitter/receivers that function within a specific frequency range. If a device only has the necessary radio for 802.11 b/g, it will not connect if the wireless router or access point is configured to only accept 802.11n or 802.11ac standards. If all devices support the same standard, the network will work at its optimum speed. If you have devices that do not support the n or ac standards, then you will have to enable legacy mode. A legacy mode wireless network environment varies between router models but can include a combination of 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, and 802.11ac. This environment provides easy access for legacy devices that need a wireless connection.
