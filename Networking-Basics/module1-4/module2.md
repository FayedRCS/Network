## Peer-to-Peer Networks

Computers can function as the server and the clients on a network. This type of network is called a P2P network.
Disadvantages of a P2P network is that the host can be slowed down acting as both a client and a server simultaneously.

In large businesses, due to potential high network traffic, it is often necessary to  have dedicated servers to support the high number of service requests.

### Pros & Cons of P2P
| Pros | Cons | 
|:---:|:---:|

| Less complex | Not as secure |
| Lower cost | Not scalable |
| Useful for simple tasks | Slow performance |

Every service must have a client server.
