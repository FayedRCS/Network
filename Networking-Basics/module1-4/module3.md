# Types of wireless networks

## Global Positioning System (GPS)

Uses satellites ot transmit signals that cover the globe. Smartphones can recieve these signals to calculate a position, usually withing a few meters.

## Wireless Fidelity (wifi)

Wifi transmitters and recievers enable a device to connect to local networks and the internet. Wifi networks are usually privately owned. A hotspot is an area where wifi signals are avaiable.
Wifi radio uses less power that cellular radio, thus saves battery life and cost.

## Bluetooth

Low-power, shorter range wireless technology that's intended to replace wired connectivity. Bluetooth technology can transmit both data and voice, it can be used to create small local networks.
Bluetooth also uses very little power which conserves battery. Up to 8 devices can be connected at once.

## Near Field Communication (NFC)

Wireless communication technology that enables data exchange in close proximity, usually within centimeters. NFC uses electromagnetic fields to transfer data.
