##The Bit

Input devices translate human interaction into binary code for the CPU to process -> Mouse, keyboard, voice-activated reciever, etc.

Output devices take binary data and transalte it into human readable form -> printer, speaker, monitors, etc.

## ASCII

computers use binary code to represent and interpret letters numbers and special characters into bits. American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is a commonly used code.

A = 01000001 -> 8 bits known as a byte
9 = 0011101
\# = 00100011
