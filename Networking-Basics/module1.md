## Categories of Personal data:

| Volunteered data | Inferred Data | Observed data |
|---|---|---|
| Data shared voluntarily| data shared as aresult of our activity | data captured by recording the actions of an individual |

## The Bit

Input devices translate human interaction into binary code for the CPU to process -> Mouse, keyboard, voice-activated reciever, etc.

Output devices take binary data and transalte it into human readable form -> printer, speaker, monitors, etc.

## ASCII

Computers use binary code to represent and interpret letters numbers and special characters into bits. American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is a commonly used code.

* A = 01000001 -> 8 bits known as a byte
* 9 = 0011101
* \# = 00100011

## Data transmission
Common methods of signal transmission used in networks:
* Electrical signals
  - Transmission is achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on copper wire
* Optical signals
  - Transmission is achieved by converting the electrical signals into light pulses
* Wireless signals
  - Transmission is achieved by using infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air
 
## Bandwidth

The rate of the data transfer is usually discussed in terms of bandwidth and throughput. Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data.
Digital bandwidth measures data flow at a given time. Bandwidth is usually measured in numbers of bits that can (theoretically) be sent across the media in seconds
* Kbps -> Thousands of bits per second
* Mbps -> Millions of bits per second
* Gbps -> Billions of bits per second

## Throughput

The measure of bits transferred across media over a given period of time. Factors usually cause throughput to not match bandwidth. Causes could be:
* Amount of data being sent or recieved over the connection
* Types of data being transmitted
* Latency created by the number of network devices encountered between source and destination.

Latency refers to the amount of time, including delays, for data to travel from point A to point B.
