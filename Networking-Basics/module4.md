## Build a Home Network

Routers typically have 2 ports; Ethernet and internet. In adition to wired ports, many include a radio antenna, and a built-in wireless access point.

## Home Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)

### Ethernet ports

Ports that connect to an internal switch portion of the router. Labeled Ethernet or LAN. All devices connected to the switch ports are on the same local network.

### Internet port

Used to connect the device to another network. It connects to a different network than the ethernet. Often used to connect to cable/DSL modem to access to the internet.
wireless

Wireless devices connect to the same local network as LAN. The internet ports is the only port connected to a different network in the default configuration.

## LAN Wireless Frequencies

The wireless technologies most frequently used in home networks are in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency ranges.
Bluetooth is a technology that makes use of the 2.4 GHz band. It is limited to low-speed, short-range communications, but has the advantage of communicating with many devices at the same time. 

Other technologies that use the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands are the modern wireless LAN technologies that conform to the various IEEE 802.11 standards. Unlike Bluetooth technology, 802.11 devices transmit at a much higher power level giving them a great range and improved throughput. Certain areas of the electromagnetic spectrum can be used without a permit.

The figure shows where wireless technologies exist on the electromagnetic spectrum:
